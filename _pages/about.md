I am currently working as a consultant at the AFRY Södertälje office, specializing in the automotive and digital field. I possess expertise in modeling, control, and estimation for dynamic systems within the automotive sector.
I hold a Ph.D. degree from the [Unit of Mechatronics](www.kth.se/mmk/mechatronics), [Department of Engineering Design](www.kth.se/mmk/department-of-machine-design-1.974324) & [Competence Center for Gas Exchange (CCGEx)](www.ccgex.kth.se) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden (2023). 

My research interests include the evaluation and optimization of energy and propulsion systems, alongside modeling and control applications. My experience covers combustion engines using renewable fuels, energy optimization for hybrid powertrain systems, discrete-event simulation for transport systems, system identification for mechatronics, and optimal control for autonomous construction vehicles.


Profession & Education
======

My doctoral studies (2018-2023) have focused on thermal analyses and optimization of propulsion systems for marine and vehicle applications, with particular interest in combustion engines using renewable fuels and electrification approaches employing hybrid driveline systems. 
The doctoral work was mainly with [Dr. Andreas Cronhjort](www.kth.se/profile/qwerty), [Professor. Mihai Mihaescu](www.kth.se/profile/mihaescu), and [Professor. Anders Christiansen Erlandsson](scholar.google.se/citations?user=Y5rj2A0AAAAJ&hl=en).
My research was conducted in the KTH-CCGEx center and was funded by the Swedish Energy Agency (Energimyndigheten), KTH-CCGEx center and its industrial partners. 

From 2016 to 2018, I was a Licentiate student / research engineer at the KTH Transport Planning division within the project of “Optimal Construction Operations”, which was funded by Volvo Construction Equipment (Construction Climate Challenge). My work at the Transport Planning division was about the optimal control application in construction operations.

Before moving to Sweden, I obtained both bachelor and master degrees from Wuhan University of Technology, China. My bachelor degree was in Energy, Power Systems and Automation (2008-2012), and the master degree was in Marine and Power Machinery Engineering, specializing in Combustion Engines and Emission Control (2012-2014). Since 2014, I worked as a development engineer for 1.5 years at the Cummins East Asia Research & Development Center (Cummins EA R&D).

Reaserach Activity & Work Experiences
------

My reaserach activity at KTH can be divided into three areas: combustion engines using renewable fuels, mechatronics related to vehicle electrification, and optimization of construction operations.

At KTH-CCGEx (2018-Present), my primary focus has been on the exergy analysis of combustion systems and exhaust pulsating flows. This study involves analyzing biofuel combustion, measuring and estimating exhaust flow fields, and developing emission control strategies.

I have also been engaged in research and teaching at the Unit of Mechatronics (2021-2023). During this period, my work focused on embedded systems for motor control, system identification of battery models, and energy optimization of hybrid powertrain systems.

KTH-CCGEx Project
------
One of the collaborative projects with industrial partners I've been involved in at KTH-CCGEx is titled "Exergy analysis for high-efficiency gas exchange systems." This project is conducted in cooperation with Wärtsilä Finland Oy.
In 2020, we participated in a magazine interview discussing the aforementioned project and its implications.: [exergy study takes a practical approach to dual-fuel engine performance](https://www.motorship.com/exergy-study-takes-practical-approach-to-dual-fuel-engine-performance/1370852.article).
