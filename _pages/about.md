I am currently working as a consultant at the AFRY Södertälje office in the automotive and digital field. I hold a Ph.D. degree from the [Unit of Mechatronics](www.kth.se/mmk/mechatronics), [Department of Engineering Design](www.kth.se/mmk/department-of-machine-design-1.974324) & [Competence Center for Gas Exchange (CCGEx)](www.ccgex.kth.se) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden (2023). 

My research interests include the evaluation and optimization of energy and propulsion systems, alongside modeling and control theory for automotive applications. My experience covers combustion engines using renewable fuel, energy optimization for hybrid powertrain systems, discrete-event simulation for transport systems, system identification for mechatronics, and optimal control for autonomous construction vehicles.


Profession & Education
======

My doctoral studies (2018-2023) have focused on thermal analyses and optimization of propulsion systems for marine and vehicle applications, with particular interest in combustion engines using renewable fuels and electrification approaches employing hybrid driveline systems. I possess expertise in modeling, control, and estimation for dynamic systems within the automotive sector. The doctoral work was mainly with [Dr. Andreas Cronhjort](www.kth.se/profile/qwerty), [Professor. Mihai Mihaescu](www.kth.se/profile/mihaescu), and [Professor. Anders Christiansen Erlandsson](scholar.google.se/citations?user=Y5rj2A0AAAAJ&hl=en). My research was conducted in the KTH-CCGEx center and was funded by the Swedish Energy Agency (Energimyndigheten), KTH-CCGEx center and its industrial partners.

Reaserach Activity
------
My work conducted at CCGEx focuses on exergy analysis of combustion systems and the exhaust pulsating flows. The study, carried out from 2018 to 2023, is related to biofuel combustion analysis, exhaust flow field measurement and estimation, as well as emission control strategies. Meanwhile, at the Unit of Mechatronics  (2021-2023), I have also been involved in teaching and research projects concerning embedded systems for motor control, system identification of battery models, and energy optimization of hybrid powertrain systems.

From  2016 to 2018, I was a Licentiate student / research engineer at the KTH Transport Planning division within the project of “Optimal Construction Operations”, which was funded by Volvo Construction Equipment (Construction Climate Challenge). My work at the Transport Planning division, Department of Civil and Architectural Engineering involves the optimal control application on construction operations.

Before moving to Sweden, I obtained both his bachelor and master degrees from Wuhan University of Technology, China. My bachelor degree was in Energy, Power Systems and Automation (2008-2012), and the master degree was in Marine and Power Machinery Engineering, specializing in Combustion Engines and Emission Control (2012-2014). Since 2014, I worked as a development engineer for 1.5 years at the Cummins East Asia Research & Development Center (Cummins EA R&D).


CCGEx Project
------
The CCGEx project (2018-2023) cooperated with industrial partners is "Exergy analysis for high-efficiency gas exchange systems". A magazine interview in 2020 about this project: [exergy study takes a practical approach to dual-fuel engine performance](https://www.motorship.com/exergy-study-takes-practical-approach-to-dual-fuel-engine-performance/1370852.article).
