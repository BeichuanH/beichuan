<p>
In introducing my personal life, I can say that I enjoy long-distance hiking, swimming, have a fondness for street food, and am addicted to salty licorice. I love drinking beer in the summer and enjoy hot pot in the winter. However, on my personal website, I want to use this opportunity to reminisce about a few cities I have lived in.

<h3>Anqing</h3>

<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>I was born in 1989 in Anqing, a riverside city in central-southern China. When introducing my hometown to friends for convenience, I often say it's close to Shanghai, but in reality, the distance between them is even greater than that from Stockholm to Copenhagen. Anqing is a typical small Chinese city, surrounded by agricultural land, with the urban area being a satellite of industrialized factory zones. My memories of Anqing are of its slow pace of life, delicious breakfasts, and bustling crowds. I grew up there until I went to college at the age of 19. Since then, I've only been able to return home intermittently, turning my hometown and loved ones into a slideshow that updates once a year in my mind. </p>

<h3>Wuhan</h3>

<p>
I completed my bachelor and master degrees in Wuhan, another riverside city but much larger than my hometown. 
After the pandemic, this city became well-known worldwide. When people now ask about Wuhan, they do so with a nervous curiosity, as if there must be some unique secret there. 
  But to me, Wuhan is just a beautiful city with distinct seasons, characterized by its moist air, spicy cuisine, and enthusiastic residents who are always a bit too emotionally. 
  In Wuhan, the student life in the technology university I attended was generally monotonous. 
  The education there overly emphasized the induction of experimental outcomes while underestimating the necessity of deductive reasoning.
  After my master, I briefly stayed in Wuhan for an internship and work. When I thought becoming a citizen of Wuhan, I got the opportunity to relocate and study in Sweden.

<h3>Stockholm</h3>

    <figcaption style="text-align: left;">To me, Stockholm in the summer is close to paradise. </figcaption>

<div style="text-align: left;">
<p> 
I never imagined I would spend so much time in Stockholm, seemingly preparing every year to leave the next or after a while, 
but always changing plans and staying here. Stockholm is a charmingly tranquil city, large enough to accommodate the convergence of diverse people, 
yet spacious enough to allow everyone their own space. Here, I've experienced the most colorful summers, the longest winters, the freshest and driest air, and the moistest winds.
It seems to be an excellent place for a respite, and unknowingly, I have rested here for eight years. 
I really love this city and its style; though far from my hometown, I can still fall asleep peacefully in the every Stockholm night.</p>

    <figcaption style="text-align: left;">KTH. My life in Stockholm is always centered around here. </figcaption>

<div style="text-align: left;">
<p> 
My life in Stockholm has always revolved around KTH. Here, I changed a lot, and KTH also protected me from changing. 
I've made many kind and pure-hearted friends and colleagues through my KTH time. 
No one finds it strange that I always want to learn new theories or try new methods; they just wonder why I'm always in a hurry to see results. 
At KTH, you're allowed to delay research progress for doing what you believe is right. 
Indeed, no place is perfect, but I'm truly grateful for this one. I may not have reached the peak of academia, but I've seen the path to the summit here.

<h3>Beijing</h3>

<div style="text-align: left;">
<p> 
I've spent many brief periods in Beijing to meet girlfriend there during my vacations over the past few years, ranging from a couple of weeks to several months.
In many ways, Beijing stands in contrast to Stockholm, with its highly developed service industry and relatively low cost of living. 
However, the hurried crowds and the purposeful daily conversations constantly remind me of the stress, anxiety, and unease people feel. 
Although I can sense and admire the historical depth and vibrant vitality of this city, the orderly and lack of a laid-back atmosphere in this capital somehow makes me feel tense and flustered.

<div style="text-align: left;">
<p> 
But as long as my girlfriend lives there, it holds a soft spot in my heart and remains a home I can always return to.
