<p>
In introducing my personal life, I can say that I enjoy long-distance hiking, swimming, have a fondness for street food, and am addicted to salty licorice. I love drinking beer in the summer and enjoy hot pot in the winter. However, on my personal website, I want to use this opportunity to reminisce about a few cities I have lived in.
</p>

<h3>Anqing</h3>

<p>I was born in 1989 in Anqing, a riverside city in central-southern China. When introducing my hometown to friends for convenience, I often say it's close to Shanghai, but in reality, the distance between them is even greater than that from Stockholm to Copenhagen. Anqing is a typical small Chinese city, surrounded by agricultural land, with the urban area being a satellite of industrialized factory zones. My memories of Anqing are of its slow pace of life, delicious breakfasts, and bustling crowds. I grew up there until I went to college at the age of 19. Since then, I've only been able to return home intermittently, turning my hometown and loved ones into a slideshow that updates once a year in my mind. </p>

<h3>Wuhan</h3>

<p>I completed my bachelor and master degrees in Wuhan, another riverside city but much larger than my hometown. After the pandemic, this city became well-known worldwide. When people now ask about Wuhan, they do so with a nervous curiosity, as if there must be some unique secret there. But to me, Wuhan is just a beautiful city with distinct seasons, characterized by its moist air, spicy cuisine, and enthusiastic residents who are always a bit too emotionally. In Wuhan, I attended a technical university where student life was generally monotonous. The education there overly emphasized the induction of experimental outcomes while neglecting deductive reasoning. After my master, I briefly stayed in Wuhan for an internship and work. Then, It was by a stroke of luck that I got the opportunity to study in Sweden. </p>

<h3>Stockholm</h3>
