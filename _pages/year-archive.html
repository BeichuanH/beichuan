I was born in 1989 in Anqing, a riverside city in central-southern China. 
When introducing my hometown to friends for convenience, I often say it's close to Shanghai, but in reality, the distance between them is even greater than that from Stockholm to Copenhagen.
Anqing is a typical small Chinese city, surrounded by agricultural land, with the urban area being a satellite of industrialized factory zones. 
My memories of Anqing are of its slow pace of life, delicious breakfasts, and bustling crowds.
