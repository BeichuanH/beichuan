Research at KTH Transport Planning Division, the Department of Civil and Architectural Engineering
------

This study at KTH from 2016-2018 within the topic “Optimal Construction Operations” results in 2 journal and 4 conference papers. My work at the Transport Planning division, Department of Civil and Architectural Engineering involves the optimal control application on construction operations. The research activities involve:

* Motion planning for autonomous wheel loaders.
* Operational patterns and emission measurements of construction vehicles.
* Discrete-event simulation for optimizing construction operations.

The research investigates optimal control methods aimed at minimizing fuel consumption and emitted pollutants from the wheel loader during the loading process. The vehicle dynamic model an autonomous wheel loader has been established in Simulink / Simscape based on the measurement data. Then, control-oriented models of the tested wheel loaders are developed in Matlab and Python to integrate with optimization and control algorithm. The path planning has been conducted using optimal control theory and the control methods such as model predictive control, H-infinity.
